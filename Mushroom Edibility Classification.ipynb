    "Although this dataset was originally contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository nearly 30 years ago, mushroom hunting (otherwise known as \"shrooming\") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?\n",

    "This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified through the target attribute `class` as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.\n",

    "First of all, get an overview of the project in your group. Then carefully read the checklist for machine learning projects and think about how you want to organize your group work. It is strongly recommended that all task items are completed by all group members. You can divide the focus among yourself, but make sure that all members are as well informed as possible about the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the checklist for machine learning projects as a guide when working on the task. Document all the individual steps that are listed there (main and sub-items). Make sure to use Markdown Cells for your documentation. Document the functionality of your algorithms (all three) with equations and explanations. Dont forget, this project is a task for five students. We expect a detailed documentation of your approach and your results.\n",

    "We are aware that there are examples and solutions for the selected data sets on popular platforms, e.g. Kaggle. You are welcome to use them as a guide. But remember that at the end of the project, your own work will be assessed. We compare the results with the popular solutions of common platforms. We would like to recognize the independence in your work and see a difference to the existing solution approaches."
